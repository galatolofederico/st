# st

One of my forks of the amazing [st](https://st.suckless.org/) (version 0.8.2)

## Patches

I have applied the following patches:

* st-externalpipe-0.8.2
* st-gruvbox-dark-0.8.2
* st-scrollback-0.8.2
* st-scrollback-mouse-0.8.2
* st-scrollback-mouse-increment-0.8.2

## Custom Features

I have implemented the *PatternHook* feature. st is able to run some code every time it detects a pattern.

For example this fork uses the color red every time it sees the pattern `<RED>`
